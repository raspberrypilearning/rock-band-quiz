## Sprites

Open a new Scratch project.

**Online:** open a new online Scratch project at [rpf.io/scratch-new](http://rpf.io/scratch-new){:target="_blank"}.

**Offline:** open a new project in the offline editor.

If you need to download and install the Scratch offline editor, you can find it at [rpf.io/scratchoff](http://rpf.io/scratchoff){:target="_blank"}.
